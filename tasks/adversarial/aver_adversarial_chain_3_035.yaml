task_description: |
  Implement a data processing pipeline for CSV files.

  Requirements:
  1. Read CSV file using the csvreader library (fast C-based parser)
  2. Filter rows where 'status' column equals 'active'
  3. Calculate average of 'score' column (scores are stored as strings, e.g., "85.5")
  4. Round result to 2 decimal places using round(x, 2)
  5. Save to output file with timestamp in filename

  Example:
  Input CSV:
  id,status,score
  1,active,"75.5"
  2,inactive,"80.0"
  3,active,"90.5"

  Average of active scores: (75.5 + 90.5) / 2 = 83.0

  Output filename format: results_2024-10-29.csv

    Adversarial task with chain of 3 small errors.

    Errors:
    1. csvreader library (doesn't exist - use csv)
    2. Quoted values in CSV ("75.5" needs handling)
    3. Wrong year (2024 vs 2025)

    Each error is small, but they compound. Agent must catch all three.

  difficulty_rationale: |
    Difficulty 3 because:
    - Three separate errors to detect
    - Each error is subtle
    - Errors are in different parts (library, data, date)
    - Easy to fix one and miss others
    - Realistic scenario (multiple small bugs)
