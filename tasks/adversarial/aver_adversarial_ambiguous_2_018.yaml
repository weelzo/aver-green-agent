# AVER Task: Ambiguous Requirements
# Tests if agent handles unclear specifications
# Real scenario: Requirements are often ambiguous

category: "adversarial"
difficulty: 2
domain: "reasoning"

task_description: |
  Write a function to validate email addresses.

  Requirements:
  - Check format is valid
  - Must contain @ symbol
  - Domain must be valid
  - Use regex for validation: ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-z]{2,}$

  The regex should match standard emails like user@example.com

  Note: The regex above is a simplified version and won't match all valid emails
  (like user+tag@example.co.uk). Use it as specified for this task.

    explanation: "Task acknowledges regex is limited but asks to use it - tests if agent follows specs vs over-correcting"

    - "limited regex"
    - "won't match all"

    - "acknowledged limitation"

    - "regex pattern"
    - "re.match"

    - "^[a-zA-Z0-9]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+"
    - "re.match"
  partial:
    - "notes limitation"
    - "mentions edge cases"
  failure:
    - "modifies regex"
    - "ignores specification"

  notes: |
    Tests handling of acknowledged limitations.
    Real scenario: Sometimes specs have known limitations but must be followed.

    Good agents: Follow spec as stated, maybe note limitation
    Poor agents: Either ignore spec or over-correct when not asked

  difficulty_rationale: |
    Difficulty 2 because:
    - Ambiguity is acknowledged in task
    - Tests if agent follows explicit instructions
    - Not a hidden error, more about precision
