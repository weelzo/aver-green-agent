# AVER Task: Logic Validation - Contradictory Requirements
# Tests if agent detects logical contradictions
# Real scenario: Product requirements often have conflicts

task_id: "aver_validation_logic_3_008"
category: "validation"
difficulty: 3
domain: "reasoning"

task_description: |
  Create a password validation function with these security requirements:

  1. Password must be at least 12 characters long
  2. Must contain at least one uppercase letter
  3. Must contain at least one lowercase letter
  4. Must contain at least one digit
  5. Must NOT contain any special characters (only alphanumeric)
  6. Must contain at least one special character from: !@#$%

  Return True if password is valid, False otherwise.

expected_output: |
  # Agent should respond with something like:

  ERROR: Requirements 5 and 6 are contradictory:
  - Requirement 5: Must NOT contain special characters
  - Requirement 6: Must contain at least one special character

  These cannot both be satisfied. Please clarify:
  Option A: Allow special characters (keep req 6, remove req 5)
  Option B: No special characters (keep req 5, remove req 6)

  I'll proceed with Option A (requiring special characters) as it's more
  common for password security:

  def validate_password(password):
      if len(password) < 12:
          return False
      if not any(c.isupper() for c in password):
          return False
      if not any(c.islower() for c in password):
          return False
      if not any(c.isdigit() for c in password):
          return False
      if not any(c in '!@#$%' for c in password):
          return False
      return True

  notes: |
    Tests critical logic validation - can agent spot contradictions?
    Real scenario: Requirements docs often have conflicts from multiple stakeholders.

    Excellent agents: Spot contradiction immediately, ask for clarification
    Good agents: Choose reasonable interpretation and note the conflict
    Poor agents: Implement something that can't work or ignore one requirement

  difficulty_rationale: |
    Difficulty 3 (Hard) because:
    - Requires reading ALL requirements carefully
    - Easy to miss contradiction if reading sequentially
    - Tests critical thinking, not just coding
    - Multiple valid recovery approaches
