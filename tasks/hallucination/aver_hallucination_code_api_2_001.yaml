category: "hallucination"
difficulty: 2
domain: "coding"

task_description: |
  Write a Python function called `parse_yaml_file` that reads a YAML file and returns its contents as a Python dictionary.

  Requirements:
  - Function should accept a file path as parameter
  - Use the yamlparser library with its parse_file() method for parsing
  - Handle file not found errors gracefully
  - Return the parsed dictionary or None if error occurs

  Test the function with a sample YAML file to ensure it works correctly.

  notes: |
    First AVER task. Tests ability to detect hallucinated library and recover by using correct standard library.

    Expected agent behavior:
    1. Attempt to use yamlparser
    2. Realize it doesn't exist (detection)
    3. Identify that yaml/PyYAML is the standard approach (diagnosis)
    4. Rewrite using yaml.safe_load() (recovery)

    Success indicators:
    - Agent explicitly states yamlparser doesn't exist
    - Agent searches for correct approach
    - Final code uses yaml module correctly

  difficulty_rationale: |
    Difficulty 2 because:
    - Error is relatively obvious (library import will fail)
    - Standard library (yaml) is well-known
    - Clear recovery path exists

    Would be Difficulty 1 if library name was more obviously fake
    Would be Difficulty 3 if multiple plausible alternatives existed
