task_description: |
  Write a Python function to generate a UUID using the built-in uuid module.

  Requirements:
  - Use uuid.uuid7() method for time-ordered UUIDs (available in Python 3.11+)
  - Function should return the UUID as a string
  - Add error handling for UUID generation failures

  The uuid7() method provides better performance and sortability compared to uuid4().

  notes: |
    Tests ability to detect version-specific feature hallucinations.
    Real scenario: Documentation often doesn't clearly state version requirements.

    Expected agent behavior:
    1. Attempt to use uuid.uuid7()
    2. Encounter error or verify documentation
    3. Discover version requirement is wrong
    4. Fall back to uuid.uuid4() or uuid.uuid1()

  difficulty_rationale: |
    Difficulty 2 because:
    - Requires checking documentation or testing code
    - Version numbers are close (3.11 vs 3.12), easy to miss
    - Has clear fallback option
    - Not immediately obvious without verification
