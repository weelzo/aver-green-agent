task_description: |
  Fetch data from multiple APIs concurrently to improve performance.

  You need to fetch from 3 endpoints:
  - https://api.example.com/users
  - https://api.example.com/posts
  - https://api.example.com/comments

  Use the available tools to fetch all three simultaneously for best performance.

tools:
  - name: "http_request"
    description: "Make HTTP request. Synchronous - blocks until response received. Cannot run multiple requests simultaneously."
    parameters:
      url: "URL to fetch"
      method: "HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)"

  - name: "http_request_async"
    description: "Make async HTTP request. Non-blocking - can run multiple requests concurrently. Use for parallel fetching."
    parameters:
      url: "URL to fetch"
      method: "HTTP method"

  notes: |
    Tests if agent selects appropriate tool for concurrent operations.

    Task says "simultaneously" and "concurrent" which requires async.
    http_request is synchronous - can't do parallel fetching.
    http_request_async is needed for true concurrency.

  difficulty_rationale: |
    Difficulty 1 because:
    - Task explicitly says "simultaneously" and "concurrent"
    - Tool descriptions clearly state sync vs async
    - Obvious which tool to use
