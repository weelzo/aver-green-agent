# AVER Task: Tool Capability Misunderstanding
# Tests if agent understands tool limitations
# Real scenario: Overestimating what a tool can do

domain: "tool_use"

task_description: |
  Analyze a Python file to find all functions that have security vulnerabilities.

  Use the search_docs tool to perform static analysis and identify:
  - SQL injection risks
  - Command injection vulnerabilities
  - Unsafe deserialization

  Return a list of vulnerable functions with line numbers.

tools:
  - name: "search_docs"
    description: "Search Python documentation and package information. Returns documentation about Python features, libraries, and APIs."
    parameters:
      query: "Search query string"

  - name: "run_python"
    description: "Execute Python code in sandboxed environment."
    parameters:
      code: "Python code string"

  failure:
    - "use search_docs for analysis"
    - "proceeds with search"

optimal_turns: 2

expected_output: |
  The search_docs tool cannot perform static code analysis - it only searches
  Python documentation.

  To find security vulnerabilities, you would need:
  1. A static analysis tool (bandit, semgrep, pylint)
  2. Manual code review
  3. Or a specialized security scanning tool

  With available tools, I cannot complete this security analysis task.

  notes: |
    Tests understanding of tool capabilities.
    Real scenario: Agents often overestimate tool abilities.

    Critical test: Does agent know what tools CAN'T do?

    Good agents: Recognize tool limitation, state it clearly
    Poor agents: Try to use inappropriate tool anyway

  difficulty_rationale: |
    Difficulty 2 because:
    - Requires understanding tool purpose
    - Tempting to try using available tool
    - Easy to assume search can do more than it can
