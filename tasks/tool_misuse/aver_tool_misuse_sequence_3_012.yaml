# AVER Task: Tool Sequence Error
# Tests if agent uses correct order of operations
# Real scenario: Some operations must happen before others

task_id: "aver_tool_misuse_sequence_3_012"
category: "tool_misuse"
difficulty: 3
domain: "tool_use"

task_description: |
  Install and use the 'colorama' library to print colored text in Python.

  Steps:
  1. First, verify the library works by importing it
  2. Then, install it if needed using: pip install colorama
  3. Finally, write code to print "Success!" in green color

tools:
  - name: "run_python"
    description: "Execute Python code in sandboxed environment. Has standard library but no external packages pre-installed."
    parameters:

  - name: "install_package"
    description: "Install Python packages using pip. Must be called before using non-standard libraries."
    parameters:
      package_name: "Package to install"

  notes: |
    Tests operation sequencing - critical for multi-step tasks.
    Real scenario: Agents must understand dependencies between steps.

    The task description has illogical sequence (verify then install).
    Good agents recognize you can't verify what's not installed.

  difficulty_rationale: |
    Difficulty 3 because:
    - Requires recognizing logical dependency
    - Task sounds reasonable at first
    - Easy to follow instructions without thinking
    - Tests causal reasoning
