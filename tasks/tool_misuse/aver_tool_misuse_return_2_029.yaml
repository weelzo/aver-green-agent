task_description: |
  Extract all email addresses from a text file and count how many unique domains are present.

  Steps:
  1. Read the file content
  2. Extract email addresses
  3. Count unique domains (part after @)

  Use the extract_emails tool which returns a comma-separated string of emails.
  Then parse and count the domains.

  - name: "read_file"
    description: "Read file contents. Returns file content as string."
    parameters:

  - name: "extract_emails"
    description: "Extract email addresses from text. Returns list of email addresses as Python list object."
    parameters:
      text: "Text to search"

  notes: |
    Tests if agent verifies tool return formats against descriptions.

    Task description says "comma-separated string" but tool description
    clearly says "returns list of email addresses as Python list object".

    Good agents should:
    1. Notice contradiction
    2. Trust tool description over task description
    3. Handle return value as list

  difficulty_rationale: |
    Difficulty 2 because:
    - Requires reading both task and tool descriptions carefully
    - Contradiction is subtle (different parts of spec)
    - Must decide which source to trust
    - Easy to miss if not checking tool docs
